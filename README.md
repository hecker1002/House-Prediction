# House-Prediction
Though its a general project , here I have used all the feature engineering processes alongwith GridSearchCV in ML to find best models and then pickled it and deployed it in my local Flask Server and built a simplee UI app
application for the user to send diff aspects of house prices and get an estimated house price in the Bangalore Area . hence , a full fledged working aWeb App using a ML model in backend .
